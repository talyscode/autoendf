# AUTOENDF
AUTOENDF is a collection of bash shell scripts for the automatic testing and processing of ENDF-6 formatted nuclear data libraries with the BNL checking codes CHECKR, FIZCON, PSYCHE and INTER, the PREPRO checking and processing codes, and the NJOY processing code. The scripts in AUTOENDF will produce input files, run the codes and automatically analyze the output. This diagnosis is obtained by scanning the various source codes for printing of warnings and errors.

## Documentation and reference
The user manual for AUTOENDF can be found here: [AUTOENDF User Manual (pdf)](https://github.com/arjankoning1/autoendf/tree/master/doc/tools.pdf).
The reference to be used for AUTOENDF is

## Installation

### Prerequisites:

The following are the prerequisites for using AUTOENDF:
  - git (if the package is downloaded via Github)
  - bash shell environment
  - Installed Fortran codes: CHECKR, FIZCON, PSYCHE, INTER (from BNL checking code suite), PREPRO and NJOY. The executables are:
    - [your bin directory]/checkr*
    - [your bin directory]/fizcon*
    - [your bin directory]/psyche*
    - [your bin directory]/inter*
    - [your bin directory]/prepro*
    - [your bin directory]/njoy*

### Instructions:

To install AUTOENDF:
```
  - git clone https://github.com/arjankoning1/autoendf.git
  - cd autoendf/bin
  - Edit autobnl and change the Thome and bin variables to match with [your bin directory]
  - Similar for autoprepro and autonjoy
```

## Sample case

A successful installation can be verified by running the sample case. 
```
cd autoendf/sample
../bin/autobnl -file n-Nb093.tendl.2021
../bin/autoprepro -file n-Nb093.tendl.2021
../bin/autonjoy -file n-Nb093.tendl.2021
```

For simple ENDF-6 format validation, the most important output is probably given in the *checkr.ers*, *njoy.ers* etc. files, which contain a
diagnosis of the (usually long) output files of the various checking and processing codes. When the *.ers* files are not empty, the associated output files *checkr.out*, *njoy.out*, etc.can be consulted for more information on the errors or warnings.

## The AUTOENDF package

The *autoendf/* directory contains the following directories and files:

+ `README.md` is this README file.
+ `LICENSE` is the License file.
+ `bin/` contains the scripts autobnl, autoprepro, autonjoy, and the not recently tested autofudge and automcnp.
+ `doc/` contains the tutorial in pdf format (in the appendices).
+ `sample/` contains the ENDF-6 formatted file *n-Nb093.tendl.2021* to be used as test case.

In total, you will need about 500 Mb of free disk space to run the sample case of AUTOENDF.
